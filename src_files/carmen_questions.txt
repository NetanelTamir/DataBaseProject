"population","Yeah, I saw her.  She told me she was headed to a place where she could blend in with all the _ATTR_ other people around.  What's it to you?"
"population","Carmen?  Ran into her the other day.  She was asking me if I knew a country that had around _ATTR_ people in it.  Told her I had no idea, I'm just a goon!"
"population","_ATTR_ ... she kept repeating this number.  Said it was how many people were in the country she was headed to."
"population","I know you hate these population clues.  Here's another one: Carmen went somewhere with a population of _ATTR_."
"population","Carmen knew you'd have trouble finding her if she went to a place with _ATTR_ people in it.  That's all I'm telling you."
"population","She left behind this tourist pamphlet.  It said that the country she's in has a population of nearly _ATTR_, which really stuck with me."
"population","All for one, and one for _ATTR_!  That was what she kept saying.  Maybe she was referring to unity of the nation's population."
"currency","Looking for Carmen?  If you find her, let me know.  She paid me only one lousy _ATTR_ for the job I pulled for her!"
"currency","I'll never tell ya where Carmen went...  But I can say that she is trying to stockpile as much money in _ATTR_ as she can to complete her plan."
"currency","She bought me a coffee and left the barista one _ATTR_ as a tip!  What a cheapskate."
"currency","Yeah, I met with Carmen, but I'll never talk!  You can take every last _ATTR_ from me and I still won't tell where I saw her!"
"currency","I dunno where she went, but she told me she was going to go exchange her money into _ATTR_ bills yesterday."
"currency","I was with her, but I won't tell where.  But if I give you some _ATTR_ money, will you let me go?"
"currency","Carmen's master plan was to steal a briefcase full of _ATTR_.  Good luck stopping her with that one."
"currency","She was planning to steal gold and exchange it for _ATTR_.  You'll never stop her!"
"flag","Carmen's briefcase had this logo on it: _ATTR_"
"flag","The note she wrote me had this logo on the stationery.  Maybe it can help you? _ATTR_"
"flag","I dunno where Carmen went, but before she left, she gave me an envelope with this logo on it: _ATTR_"
"flag","You should have seen the sportscar she was driving!  It had a little flag on it that looked like this: _ATTR_"
"flag","Carmen told me to meet her in the nation with this flag: _ATTR_  But I dunno which one that is, exactly.  Do you?"
"flag","She told me she was gonna meet her contact under the flag outside the capital building.  She showed me this picture: _ATTR_"
"capital","The last I saw of her she was living it up at a hotel in _ATTR_.  Such a lovely place, such a lovely face."
"capital","Look, she told me to meet her in the capital city of _ATTR_, but I dunno where that is.  I'm just a hired goon!"
"capital","Carmen left me a message from _ATTR_.  She said it was the capital of the country where she was staying.  I woulda met her there if it weren't for you lousy cops!"
"capital","Carmen and I went bungee jumping in _ATTR_.  You probably don't even know where that is!"
"capital","Please let me go!  The last place I saw Carmen was _ATTR_, I promise."
"capital","I saw her at the airport in _ATTR_.  She might not be there any more, but you could check there at least."
"capital","She told me she was headed to _ATTR_ to close a big deal related to her operation.  That's all I know."
"capital","I saw her boarding the train for _ATTR_."
"language","She kept shouting at me in _ATTR_.  What a rude woman!"
"language","I don't know where she went, but the message she sent me was written in _ATTR_.  Does that help you out?"
"language","I tried to do business with her, but I am rusty with my _ATTR_, so I called it off."
"language","Dunno where she went.  But I had to bring my _ATTR_ dictionary to our deal, because that was what her associates were speaking."
"language","Do you speak _ATTR_?  She said she was looking for someone who did."
"language","I'll never talk.  All I will tell you is that she went to a country where they speak _ATTR_."
"language","Dunno where she went.  I don't even think Carmen is the real crime boss.  Her henchman was giving her orders in _ATTR_ and she was translating them."
"map","Carmen told me to go here, to the country highlighted on this map: _ATTR_"
"map","The stationery she wrote to me had this small map logo on it: _ATTR_"
"map","Okay, I'll talk!  Here's where she told me to meet her: _ATTR_"
"map","I travel so much, I forget where I saw her.  But I highlighted my last stop on my map; maybe she's still there: _ATTR_"
"map","Hoho, you Americans don't know geography, so you probably won't find her even if I show you exactly where she is on a map: _ATTR_"
"map","Carmen drew me a rough map of her getaway destination.  It looked like this: _ATTR_"
"incorrect","Nope, haven't seen her, pal."
"incorrect","Carmen who?"
"incorrect","I swear, I'm innocent!  You've got the wrong person."
"incorrect","No hablo ingles!"
"incorrect","Wish I could help you out, but she hasn't been around these parts lately."
"incorrect","Carmen Sandiego?  Doesn't ring a bell.  Sorry."
"incorrect","Man, you detectives aren't as good as you used to be."
"incorrect","How dare you accuse me of such a thing!  I have never heard of the person you're asking about."
